TODO:

- popup to warn that the imported notes will clear everything local, so save first
- dark mode
- multiple languages ?
- use firebase to stores shared notes to shorten share url
- share notes with a link, the router take care of interpreting the link
- add a button to share the link
- maybe have some kind of deletion system for the shared notes (see if firebase can do it)
